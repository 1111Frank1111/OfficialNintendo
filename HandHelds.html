        <h3>Game Boy (1989 - 2006)</h3>
        <p>Another series of handhelds that can have multiple games played on the system rather than a dedicated game to a console like the Game & Watch.
          <br>--The Game boy (1989), Game boy Pocket (1996) and light (1998) play the same 8 bit display. But in the iterations the game boy got smaller until the light when it had a backlit screen helping it to see the screen in dark places.
          <br>--The Game boy colour (1998) is the first game boy to display color and to have multiple coloured handheld choices. And they started off the branch of having different coloured consoles. It provided backwards compatibility for the original Gameboy.
          <br>--The Game boy advance (2001), SP (2003) and micro (2006) included a series of game boy’s that enabled more resolution and power for the game boy line up which included backwards compatibility for the original gameboy and Gameboy color. The Game Boy Advance SP was the only Game boy to include the folded option of the handhelds, and was later the inspiration of the DS but the SP only had one screen whereas the DS had 2.</p>

        <h3>DS (2004 - 2009)</h3>

        <p>The “Nintendo DS” is the top handheld console sold of all time selling at 154.02 million units and is the second most sold console counting including home consoles. The Nintendo DS has a similar cartridge like setup except it has a smaller and more efficient cartridge.
          <br>--The DS (2004) was the first of the iterations making it the thickest DS and the first to have the dual screen display with the bottom screen as a touch screen and was inspired by the game boy SP.

          <br>--The DS lite (2007) was the second iteration coming with a thinner approach to the ds line up and going by the looks of it, it is the face of marketing of the ds.

          <br>--The DSi (2009) was the first DS to have a camera but the game boy (successor) did have a add on peripheral for the handheld, while this one had a built in camera. This was the first handheld to have an online connection. And the first to have an XL (2009) (extra large version of a handheld).
          <br>And the backwards compatibility is on the Nintendo's DS, and Lite were making it compatible with Game Boy Advance games.

        <h3>3DS (2011 - 2017)</h3>
        <p>Another series of handhelds which continued the lineup of dual screens but by adding in more of a resolution and a built in 3d feature depending on the system.  And all of them did contain DS original compatibility.
          <br>--The 3DS (2011) was the first of its line up that had the 3d feature and to be known for the face of the 3DS.
          <br>--The 3DS XL (2012) was released a year after the original 3DS making it equipped with a dual processor making it 2 times faster than its successor.
          <br>--The 2DS (2013) was the cheaper option that contained no 3D and had a built-in of the local play button making it more easier to design. And this was the the first and only iteration only DS or 3DS do have no fold making it iconic to the Game boy’s era.

          <br>--The “New” 3DS and “New” 3DS XL (2015) have new features including 2 extra back buttons, a second stick called the c-stick and the cartridge port being the first to have it at the front of the handheld. It was also compatible with DS, 3DS and very few “New” 3DS exclusives plus SNES virtual console. This console was quad core explaining why the console has a few exclusives.

          <br>--The “New” 2DS XL (2017) was also another option that was cheaper than its previous 3DS iteration but making it cheaper to make without its 3D feature. The cartridge port was at the front and the the first to have a cover for the port.
