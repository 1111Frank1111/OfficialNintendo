          <p>The cartridge has been with nintendo since the beginning and it will follow it to the end because of the Nintendo Switch.
            <br>The Cartridge (ROM) is a removable enclosed device to connect to a consumer electronic device such as a computer, video game console or handheld. Nintendo has done this in their Consoles for their:
            <br>--NES/Famicom (with its clones like Terminator)
            <br>--SNES/Super Famicom
            <br>--Nintendo 64
            <br>--Game Boy
            <br>--Game Boy Color
            <br>--Game Boy Advance
            <br>--Virtual Boy
            <br>--Pokémon mini
            <br>--Nintendo DS
            <br>--Nintendo 3DS
            <br>--Nintendo Switch
            <br>And the latest device they released which is a Hybrid Known as the Nintendo Switch (2017), is a flashback for the home console market since the N64 (1991), but has been the standard for all their portable/handhelds ever since the Gameboy (1989) to the “New” 2DS (2017).
          </p>
          <p>The cartridge slot could also be used for hardware additions, for example the SNES, N64 and Gameboy.
            <br>For example the SNES and N64, has power added to the Consoles in a for of a cartridge, the SNES used it to cheat 3D rendering and, the N64 for Power acting as RAM (Random Accessing Memory).
            <br>The N64 used cartridges when most home consoles had shifted to CD-ROMs, because they wanted to avoid extra costs although it did take longer to make a game for a cartridge.
