        <h2>The D-pad</h2>
        <p>Arcades predominantly used Joysticks for a better gaming experience and interface. Game console started to use the design but, eventually fell short and became hard to multitask. Ever since 1980 the the dice-like control/directional pad interface was influenced with other competitors like Atari and the Magnavox Odyssey joysticks. To the year 1982, Gunpei Yokoi from Nintendo invented the legendary D-Pad for the Game & Watch series on the donkey kong classic. Yokoi’s version of the d-pad became an industry standard. In 1983 the Japan release of the NES, called the famicom started to take on the D-Pad for the home console market. Nintendo had adopted their D-pad into all of their game consoles ever since the NES and so have other competitor products while bringing on their own designs. The company did not invent the D-pad but they did innovate the invention into the market we know today.</p>

        <h2>The Modern Side-Scroller </h2>
        <p>Its was an evolution that was later carried on with the Donkey kong with its base actions like jumps to complicate the upcoming obstacles. Namco’s Pac-Land with its hatted cartoon version of Pac-Man jogging through side-view levels that scrolled in both directions. The video game series of Super Mario Bros. was the pop-culture conquest, a weirdly accessible adventure full of evil mushrooms and warp zones. It wasn’t so much what Super Mario Bros. did, but rather how it did it by combining power-ups, item collecting with different game physics to tie it all together. Mario’s running and jumping controls were accessible and, their influence appears in just about any side-scroller. </p>

        <h2>Portable Video Game Consoles</h2>
        <p>The portables have been around nintendo for a long time before nintendo, normally primitive electronic trinkets. Nintendo were the same with the company’s Game & Watch device that used basic graphics and provided only one game but variations in each handheld. Mony was to be made in the interchangeable cartridges with early attempts like the milton bradley’s 1979 microvision. But short-lived and lasted only for 2 years. The Game boy was a black and white (Greenish tint). Limited graphics but equivalent to the NES and had the audience of both Kids and Parents. </p>

        <h2>Selfies</h2>
        <p>Game Boy’s made a huge variety of range with their cartridges in which they served for many things such as as fish locators, translators, word processors, personal organizers, and sewing machine attachments. The Game boy camera was released in 1998 which was a deviced helps to capture black and white photos, edit and play mini games ir print them through a thermal printer accessory. Eventually it came to be a standard to have a camera on handhelds and later down the road Nintendo patented a the phone and game boy feature in 2001. </p>

        <h2>Rumbling controllers</h2>
<p>The N64 was the first to progress in rumbling controls. But other competitors like Pc, and Playstation used CD’s for a format. For some reason nintendo stuck with the cartridge. The Expansion slot for the N64 controllers was first for memory cards or cartridges, but ever since the release of the Star Fox 64 it became the rumble pack. The rumble pack simply just simulated the damage impacts, engine noise, or anything that the game and the player interacted with. Its was a simple innovation but, replicated a lot throughout competitor products. Now it’s an industry standard to have one. </p>
